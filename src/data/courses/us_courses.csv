1,1,,,Pine Valley Golf Club,Pine Valley,NJ,Private,19,5,true,false,true,A genuine original, its unique character is forged from the sandy pine barrens of southwest Jersey. Founder George Crump had help from now-legendary architects H.S. Colt, A.W. Tillinghast, George C. Thomas Jr. and Walter Travis. Hugh Wilson (of Merion fame) and his brother Alan finished the job, while William Flynn and Perry Maxwell made revisions. Throughout the course, Pine Valley blends all three schools of golf design—penal, heroic and strategic—often times on a single hole. Recent tree removal at selected spots has revealed some gorgeous views of the sandy landscape upon which the course is routed, and Tom Fazio has put his own touch on the design with bunker remodels that have given the barrens a more intricate and ornate look.,George Crump; H.S.

2,2,,,Augusta National Golf Club,Augusta,GA,Private,12,5,true,false,true,No club has tinkered with its golf course as often or as effectively over the decades as has Augusta National Golf Club, mainly to keep it competitive for the annual Masters Tournament, an event it has conducted since 1934, with time off during WWII. All that tinkering has resulted in an amalgamation of design ideas, with a routing by Alister Mackenzie and Bobby Jones, some Perry Maxwell greens, some Trent Jones water hazards, some Jack Nicklaus mounds and swales and, most recently, extensive rebunkering and tree planting by Tom Fazio. The tinkering continues, including the lengthening of the par-4 fifth in the summer of 2018, the lengthening of the 11th and 15th holes in 2022, and the addition of 35 yards to the famed par-5 13th in 2023.,Alister Mackenzie; Bobby Jones; Perry Maxwell; Trent Jones; Jack Nicklaus; Tom Fazio,1934,Hosts the annual Masters Tournament since 1934 (except during WWII).

3,3,,,Cypress Point Club,Pebble Beach,CA,Private,27,5,true,false,true,From Golf Digest Architecture Editor emeritus Ron Whitten: Cypress Point, the sublime Monterey Peninsula work of sandbox sculpture, whittled Cypress and chiseled coastline, has become Exhibit A in the argument that classic architecture has been rendered ineffectual by modern technology. I'm not buying that argument. Those who think teeny old Cypress Point is defenseless miss the point of Alister MacKenzie's marvelous design. MacKenzie relished the idea that Cypress Point would offer all sorts of ways to play every hole. That philosophy still thrives, particularly in the past decade, after the faithful restoration of MacKenzie's original bunkers by veteran course superintendent Jeff Markow.,Alister MacKenzie,,Restoration of MacKenzie's original bunkers by Jeff Markow.

4,4,,,Shinnecock Hills Golf Club,Southampton,NY,Private,11,5,true,false,true,Generally considered to be the earliest links in America, heavily remodeled by C.B. Macdonald, then replaced (except for three holes) by William S. Flynn in the early 1930s, it's so sublime that its architecture hasn't really been altered for nearly 60 years. Stands of trees that once framed many holes have been removed, and in 2012, the team of Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw did make a few changes, mostly greens and fairways expansions and new mowing patterns, though those were modified in preparation for the 2018 U.S. Open, won by Brooks Koepka.

5,5,,,Oakmont Country Club,Oakmont,PA,Private,25,5,true,false,true,Once tens of thousands of trees were removed between the early 1990s and 2015 (most planted in the 1960s), Oakmont's original penal design was re-established, with the game's nastiest, most notorious bunkers (founder-architect H.C. Fownes staked out bunkers whenever and where ever he saw a player hit an offline shot), deep drainage ditches and ankle-deep rough. Oakmont also has the game's swiftest putting surfaces, which were showcased during the U.S. Open in 2016, despite early rains that slowed them down a bit. Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner made bunker modifications and expanded the greens throughout the course in 2023 in preparation for the 2025 U.S. Open. The USGA has already awarded Oakmont three additional Opens between 2033 and 2049, reinforcing its title as the Host of the Most U.S. Opens ever.,H.C.

6,6,merion-gc,Merion Golf Club,Merion Golf Club: East,Ardmore,PA,Private,28,5,true,false,true,Merion East has long been considered the best course on the tightest acreage in America, and when it hosted the U.S. Open in 2013, its first since 1981, the present generation of big hitters couldn't conquer this clever little course. They couldn't consistently hit its twisting fairways, which are edged by creeks, hodge-podge rough and OB stakes. Additionally, players couldn't consistently hold its canted greens, edged by bunkers that stare back. Justin Rose won with a 72-hole total of one-over-par, two ahead of Jason Day and Phil Mickelson. With Gil Hanse's extensive two-year renovation after that tournament, making even more improvements at Merion's East Course, the design should be even more polished and pristine when the U.S. Amateur returns in 2026 and the U.S. Open returns again in 2030.,Hugh Wilson (original); Gil Hanse (renovation),1912,Best course on tightest acreage in America.

7,7,,,National Golf Links of America,Southampton,NY,Private,23,5,true,false,true,This is where golf architect Seth Raynor got his start. A civil engineer by training, he surveyed holes for architect C.B. Macdonald, who scientifically designed National Golf Links as a fusion of his favorite features from grand old British golf holes. National Golf Links is a true links containing a marvelous collection of holes. As the 2013 Walker Cup reminded us, Macdonald's versions are actually superior in strategy to the originals, which is why National's design is still studied by golf architects today, its holes now replicated elsewhere. Hard to fathom that National Golf Links of America was not ranked among America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses from 1969 until 1985. Theories involve possible hazy, rough around the edges conditions during the 1970s that dulled the architecture (something that didn't impact over-the-fence Shinnecock Hills), the course's relatively short length that didn't meet the era's championship course standards, or simply that the unique Macdonald shapes and concepts were too quirky for the prevailing tastes of the era. No matter now. National is rightly positioned as one of America's most original and influential expressions of golf course architecture.,C.B.

8,8,,,Sand Hills Golf Club,Mullen,NE,Private,19,5,true,false,true,The golf course wasn't so much designed as discovered. Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw trudged back and forth over a thousand acres of rolling sand hills in central Nebraska, flagging out naturally occurring fairways and greens. By moving just 4,000 cubic yards of earth and letting the winds shape the bunkers, the duo created what is undoubtedly the most natural golf course in America—a timeless course design. For decades, winter winds had always reshaped the bunkers, but course officials have recently discovered a method to prevent that. At the close of the season, they spray the surface of the sand in bunkers with a product that creates a crust to resist the howling winds.,Bill Coore; Ben Crenshaw,1990s,Minimalist design with only 4,000 cubic yards of earth moved.

9,12,,,Pebble Beach Golf Links,Pebble Beach,CA,Public,46,5,true,true,true,Not just the greatest meeting of land and sea in American golf, but the most extensive one, too, with nine holes perched immediately above the crashing Pacific surf—the fourth through 10th plus the 17th and 18th. Pebble's sixth through eighth are golf's real Amen Corner, with a few Hail Marys thrown in over an ocean cove on the eighth from atop a 75-foot-high bluff. Pebble hosted a successful U.S. Amateur in 2018 and a sixth U.S. Open in 2019. Recent improvements include the redesign of the once-treacherous 14th green and reshaping the par-3 17th green, both planned by Arnold Palmer's Design Company a few years back, and modifications to the green at the famous eighth hole, which we deemed the second Greatest Hole in America.

10,9,,,Fishers Island Club,Fishers Island,NY,Private,24,5,true,false,true,Undoubtedly, Fishers Island Club is the most dazzling design by architect Seth Raynor, who died in early 1926 before the course had officially opened. His steeply banked bunkers and geometric greens harmonize perfectly with the linear panoramas of the Atlantic Ocean and Long Island Sound. The quality of the holes is also superb, with all Raynor's usual suspects, including not one but two Redan greens, one on a par-4. The setting on a private island accessible only by ferry adds to the mystique, and three holes (four, five and nine) appear on our ranking of America's 100 Greatest Holes.,Seth Raynor,1926,Seth Raynor died before official opening.

11,13,,,Chicago Golf Club,Wheaton,IL,Private,21,5,true,false,true,Chicago Golf Club opened the country's first 18-hole course in 1893, built by C.B. Macdonald, the preeminent golf expert in the U.S. at the time. Two years later, Macdonald built the club a different course after the membership moved to a new location in Wheaton, Ill.: a really first-class 18-hole course of 6,200 yards, he wrote. Members played that course until 1923 when Seth Raynor, who began his architectural career as Macdonald's surveyor and engineer, redesigned it using the ideal hole concepts his old boss had developed 15 years earlier (he kept Macdonald's routing, which placed all the O.B. on the left—C.B. sliced the ball). For reasons of history and practicality, no major remodels have occurred since then, allowing the club to merely burnish the architecture by occasionally upgrading worn parts, adjusting grassing lines, and recently, reestablishing a number of lost bunkers that had been filled in over time.,C.B.

12,10,,,Seminole Golf Club,Juno Beach,FL,Private,23,5,true,false,true,A majestic Donald Ross design with a clever routing on a rectangular site, each hole at Seminole encounters a new wind direction. The routing is perhaps the only thing that remains of Ross' vision. The greens are no longer his, replaced 60 years ago in a regrassing effort that showed little appreciation for the original rolling contours. The bunkers aren't Ross either. Dick Wilson replaced them in 1947, his own version meant to imitate crests of waves on the adjacent Atlantic. A few years back, Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw redesigned the bunkers again, set lower, closer to the way Ross had them, along with exposing sandy expanses in the rough. The club is about to embark on another major remodel by Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner intended to finally recreate Ross' internal green movements based on his blueprints and elevate sections of the course to remediate drainage concerns. Seminole has long been one of America's most exclusive clubs, which is why it was thrilling to see it on TV for a first time during the TaylorMade Driving Relief match, and then again for the 2021 Walker Cup.,Donald Ross; Dick Wilson; Bill Coore; Ben Crenshaw; Gil Hanse; Jim Wagner (upcoming remodel),,Donald Ross original design.

13,11,winged-foot-gc,Winged Foot Golf Club,Winged Foot Golf Club: West,Mamaroneck,NY,Private,30,5,true,false,true,Gone are all the Norway Spruce that once squeezed every fairway of Winged Foot West. It's now gloriously open and playable, at least until one reaches the putting surfaces, perhaps the finest set of green contours the versatile architect A.W. Tillinghast ever did, now restored to original parameters by architect Gil Hanse. The greens look like giant mushrooms, curled and slumped around the edges, proving that as a course architect, Tillinghast was not a fun guy. Winged Foot West was tamed, somewhat, by Bryson DeChambeau in winning the 2020 U.S. Open that was played in September, but he was the only competitor to finish under par in his six-shot victory.,A.W.

14,15,,,Friar's Head Golf Club,Riverhead,NY,Private,19,5,true,false,true,The challenge for architects Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw at Friar's Head was to design some holes in breathtaking sand dunes perched 200 feet above Long Island Sound, and other holes on an ordinary potato field to the south. Said Crenshaw, Our job was to marry the two distinct elements. We didn't want one nine up in the dunes and the other down on the flat. The solution was to move the routing back and forth and to artfully reshape the farm fields into gentle links-like land. They pulled it off so impressively that Friar's Head has moved up the rankings each survey period since its debut at 34th in 2011 to 14th this year.,Bill Coore; Ben Crenshaw,2011,Opened in 2011 at 34th rank, moved up to 14th.

15,14,,,Crystal Downs Country Club,Frankfort,MI,Private,27,5,true,false,true,Perry Maxwell, the Midwest associate of architect Alister MacKenzie, lived on site while constructing the course to MacKenzie's plans, but there's evidence Maxwell exercised considerable artistic license on some holes. Whomever did it, Crystal Downs has fairways that zigzag and rumble over the glacial landscape and greens that have doglegs in them. One drawback is that the putting surfaces are so old-fashioned that they're too steep for today's green speeds. But that's part of Crystal Downs' appeal. It's short but has considerable bite.,Alister MacKenzie; Perry Maxwell,,Perry Maxwell lived on-site during construction.

16,16,los-angeles-cc,Los Angeles Country Club,Los Angeles Country Club: North,Los Angeles,CA,Private,21,5,true,false,true,It's on the edge of Tinsel Town, but the architecture of the North Course at Los Angeles Country Club has been solid gold ever since its 2010 restoration by architect Gil Hanse and partner Jim Wagner. It matters not that Hanse's team didn't replicate the bunkering style of original architect George C. Thomas, but rather the more visually exciting style of Thomas' associate, William P. Bell. The first nine plays rustically up and down a shallow canyon with holes switching back and forth across a dry barranca, and the second nine loops across a more spacious upland section with one par 3 (the 11th) that can stretch to nearly 300 yards and another (the 15th) that often plays just 90 yards. The hole strategies reinstituted by Hanse provided an intriguing examination when LACC's North course hosted the 2023 U.S. Open as Wyndham Clark beat Rory McIlroy by a stroke.,George C.

17,19,the-country-club,The Country Club,The Country Club: The Main Course,Brookline,MA,Private,2,4.5,true,false,true,The Country Club's 18-hole course, which was the scene of the 1963 and 1988 U.S. Opens, is not the 18-hole course ranked by Golf Digest. Those events were played on a composite course that utilizes several holes from the club's third nine, Primrose, designed by William Flynn. We rank the combination of the Main Course (the Clyde and Squirrel nines), clearly good enough to be one of the top courses in the world. Gil Hanse performed some course restoration prior to the 2013 U.S. Amateur at The Country Club and again before the 2022 U.S. Open, won by Matthew Fitzpatrick. The USGA used a new configuration of 18 holes for that championship, eliminating the par-4 fourth and adding the tiny, downhill par-3 11th to the mix, the first time the hole was used since the 1913 Open won by Francis Ouimet.,William Flynn; Gil Hanse (restoration),,Gil Hanse restoration before 2013 U.S. Amateur and 2022 U.S. Open.

18,18,,,Riviera Country Club,Pacific Palisades,CA,Private,28,5,true,false,true,A compact and shrewd design by George C. Thomas Jr. and associate William P. Bell, Riviera features everything from a long Redan par-3 to a bunker in the middle of a green to an alternate-fairway par-4. With its 18th green at the base of a natural amphitheater, and its primary rough consisting of club-grabbing Kikuyu, Riviera seems tailor-made as a tournament venue. It hosted a PGA Championship in 1995, a U.S. Senior Open in 1998 and a U.S. Amateur in 2017, but no U.S. Open since 1948. Riviera was recently awarded the 2031 U.S. Open, and it will also host the 2028 Olympics. But it's the site of an annual PGA Tour event, which is even better exposure to the golf world.,George C.

Since its opening in 1974, Jack Nicklaus has remodeled every hole at Muirfield Village, some more than once, using play at the PGA Tour's annual Memorial Tournament for some guidance. The renovation in 2020 was one of the most extensive and included the rebuilding of every hole, the shifting of greens and tees, strategic changes to the iconic par 5s and a new, more player-friendly par-3 16th, though that hole, too, has been tweaked since.

20,20,oakland-hills-cc,Oakland Hills Country Club,Oakland Hills Country Club: South Course,Bloomfield Hills,MI,Private,54,5,true,false,true,Donald Ross felt his 1918 design was out of date for the 1951 U.S. Open and was prepared to remodel it. Sadly, he died in 1948, so Robert Trent Jones got the job. His rebunkering was overshadowed by ankle-deep rough, and after Ben Hogan closed with a 67, one of only two rounds under par-70 all week, to win his second consecutive Open, he complained that Jones had created a Frankenstein. Seventy-plus years later, Oakland Hills is even longer, but its bite wasn't severe when it hosted the 2016 U.S. Amateur. In 2019, the South course closed as Gil Hanse and his team significantly renovated the course with the intention of removing the Jones-era influences and restoring its Ross feel. They did that by expanding greens to recapture what are some of Ross's best contours, removing trees to show off the rolling landscape and shifting bunkers back to where Ross, not RTJ (or RTJ's son Rees, during previous remodels), placed them. The course re-opened in Spring 2021, and though a crippling fire destroyed the club's iconic clubhouse, the USGA delivered some kind news to the club, bringing the 2034 and 2051 U.S. Opens to Oakland Hills—as well as a number of upcoming USGA championships.,Donald Ross; Robert Trent Jones; Gil Hanse (2019 renovation),1918,Ross original (1918), died before 1951 remodel.

21,22,oak-hill-cc,Oak Hill Country Club,Oak Hill Country Club: East,Rochester,NY,Private,27,5,true,false,true,Back in 1979, George Fazio and nephew Tom were roundly criticized by Donald Ross fans for removing a classic Ross par-4 on Oak Hill East and replacing it with two new holes, including the bowl-shaped par-3 sixth, which would later become the scene of four aces in two hours during the second round of the 1989 U.S. Open. They also built a pond on another par-3 and relocated the green on the par-4 18th. The club hired golf architect Andrew Green to remodel those holes to bring them more in line with Donald Ross' original style. In addition to putting the final touches (at least for now) on a significant tree removal program, Green re-established Ross' original par-4 hole, then the fifth and now playing as the sixth (pictured here). Reconstruction occurred after the 2019 Senior PGA Championship on the East Course and was completed in May 2020.

But Trent was an even more forceful personality than the flamboyant MacKenzie, so Peachtree reflects far more of Trent's notions of golf than Bobby's, particularly in designing for future equipment advances. When it opened, Peachtree measured in excess of 7,200 yards, extremely long for that era. It boasted the longest set of tees in America (to provide flexibility on holes) and the country's most enormous greens (to spread out wear and tear). As it turns out, Trent was a visionary, and decades later, other designers followed his lead to address advances in club and ball technology.,Bobby Jones; Robert Trent Jones,,Collaboration between Bobby Jones and Robert Trent Jones. 7,200+ yards when opened.

To best utilize ocean frontage, Tom Doak came up with an unorthodox routing that includes four par 3s on the back nine. Holes seem to emerge from the landscape rather than being superimposed onto it with rolling greens and rumpled fairways framed by rugged sand dunes and marvelously grotesque bunkers. The secret is that Doak moved a lot of earth in some places to make it look like he moved very little, but the result is a course with sensual movements, like a tango that steps toward the coast and back again, dipping in and out of different playing arenas from the secluded sand blowouts to the exposed bluffs and all variations in between.,Tom Doak,,Second course at Bandon Dunes Resort.

Designer Tom Fazio said that a budget was necessary at Shadow Creek to perform what he now calls total site manipulation, creating an environment where none existed by carving rolling hills and canyons from the flat desert floor north of Las Vegas and pumping in plenty of water.

By the time the club found funds to expand it to 18, original architect Perry Maxwell had passed away, but his son Press was able to add nine more holes seamlessly in the 1950s, putting three on the front nine and six on the back.

There are no rakes at Whistling Straits, in keeping with the notion that this is a transplanted Irish links.

Nearly every hole bends left or right, posing critical tee shots that must risk something. The putting surfaces have the classic Maxwell Rolls, and most are guarded by simple yet effective bunkers.

Other than reducing the contours in a couple of greens (particularly the 18th) in the late 1990s, and adjusting the bunkering in 2008, Dye left the course alone for most of his career.

This manufactured linksland-meets-lagoons layout might well be Pete Dye's most diabolical creation. Every hole is edged by sawgrass, every green has tricky slopes and every bunker merges into bordering sand dunes. Strung along nearly three miles of ocean coast, Dye took his wife Alice's advice and perched fairways and greens so golfers can actually view the Atlantic surf over a ridge of beach dunes. That also exposes shots and putts to ever-present and sometimes fierce coastal winds. The Ocean Course will forever be linked with Phil Mickelson and his improbable victory at the 2021 PGA Championship, as well as Rory McIlroy's romp in 2012.,Pete Dye,1991,Designed for 1991 Ryder Cup.

Between fairways and tree lines, they established vast bands of native hardpan sand dotted with clumps of wiregrass and scattered pine needles. They reduced the irrigation to mere single rows in fairways to prevent grass from ever returning to the new sandy wastelands. Playing firm and fast, it was wildly successful as the site of the 2014 Men's and Women's U.S. Opens, played on consecutive weeks, and produced an even more exciting Open in 2024 when Bryson DeChambeau beat Rory McIlroy on the final hole.

A.W. Tillinghast remodeled the course in 1923, establishing its signature greens and bunkering. He also added the par-3 seventh, called the Duel Hole, because its location marks the spot of the last legal duel in America.

With no carts and dry, tan fescue turf on fairways and greens, Ballyneal is even more austere than Sand Hills. It provides absolute firm and fast conditions, and with many greens perched on hilltops, the effect of wind on putts must be considered. The rolling landforms, topsy-turvy greens and half-par holes make playing here feel like a joyride.

35,35,olympic-club,The Olympic Club,The Olympic Club: Lake,San Francisco,CA,Private,35,5,true,false,true,It seems fitting that, in a town where every house is a cliffhanger, every U.S. Open played at Olympic has been one, too. For decades, the Lake was a severe test of golf. Once, it was a heavily forested course with canted fairways hampered by just a single fairway bunker. By 2009, the forest had been considerably cleared away, leaving only the occasional bowlegged cypress with knobby knees. The seventh and 18th greens were redesigned, and a new par-3 eighth added. Despite those changes, the 2012 U.S. Open stuck to the usual script: a ball got stuck in a tree, slow-play warnings were given, a leader snap-hooked a drive on 16 in the final round and a guy named Simpson won. If the past was predictable, the future of the Lake Course might be more mysterious after Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner completed a remodeling in 2023 in preparation for the 2028 PGA Championship. The holes are even more breathable than before, with additional tree decluttering, the greens have been expanded for more hole locations and the bunkers don't seem so deep and disconnected with the greens as they did. That old seventh hole was also scrapped in favor of a new drivable par-4 playing to a new greensite closer to the eighth tee. What hasn't changed is the Lake Course's secret ingredient, the mysterious hillside atmosphere that makes balls fall out of the air and the holes play much longer than their yardage.,Gil Hanse; Jim Wagner (2023 remodel),,Forest cleared by 2009. 7th and 18th greens redesigned, new par-3 8th added.

36,34,,,Ohoopee Match Club,Cobbtown,GA,Private,15,5,true,false,true,From Golf Digest Architecture Editor emeritus Ron Whitten: I've been told Gil Hanse had first examined the site of Ohoopee Match Club as far back as 2006 considered it ideal for golf: gently rolling terrain with no severe elevation changes, and beautiful sandy soil deposited by the nearby Ohoopee River, perfect for drainage and firm, fast conditions. The ground around tiny Cobbtown, Ga., is also perfect for growing onions—it's just northeast of Vidalia, world-famous for the Vidalia onion. Indeed, Ohoopee's logo is a freshly picked onion, although if you look closely, its roots are three writhing snakes. Any symbolism pertaining to match play is uncertain; perhaps it simply suggests the sort of putts one will face. What's the composition of a course meant for match play? One might think it would contain lots of penal hazards, because a triple bogey on any particular hole would not be fatal in match play. Perhaps the targets would be smaller than normal, to level the playing field between big hitters and short-but-accurate golfers. That's not the composition of the 7,325-yard championship course at Ohoopee. Hanse did produce dramatic visuals in this sandy locale that hark back to portions of Pinehurst and Pine Valley, from long expanses of sandy rough dotted with native plants to deep, foreboding pits of sand, but they're mostly on the far perimeter of holes.,Gil Hanse,2006,Hanse examined site in 2006.

Then it became a darling of the PGA Tour as host of the 2011 and 2016 Barclays.

When Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw were hired to address the bunkering at Old Town, they opted not to reproduce the original bunkers (some of which were enormous) but rather emulate their gnarly shapes, edges and vegetation in places where bunkers naturally fit. Lots of trees had already been removed, but the architects convinced the club to get rid of even more. Now, a single swath of fairway connects the seventh, eighth, ninth, 17th and 18th holes.

But at Congaree, 30 minutes inland from Beaufort, S.C., he at least had great material: sand, in the form of two deep sections of it separated by a lowcountry wetland area. The sand made it easy to scoop and shape long ridgelines, creating significant movement across an otherwise level property—and dozens of stately live oaks, carefully transplanted for effect—further outline the design. Finely edged Melbourne-style bunkers sweep up to the edges of fairways and into greens, catching shots that drift too far and leading to challenging hi-lo recovery situations. Congaree hosted the 2022 CJ Cup after making its debut as a tour venue for the previous year's Palmetto Championship, which replaced that year's Canadian Open.,Tom Fazio,,30 minutes inland from Beaufort.

The 1980 design was pure Pete Dye, who set out to test the world's best golfers by mixing the demands of distance with target golf. Most greens are ringed by random lumps, bumps and hollows, what Dye called his grenade attack architecture. His ultimate target hole is the heart-pounding sink-or-swim island green 17th, which offers no bailout, perhaps unfairly in windy Atlantic coast conditions. The 17th has spawned over a hundred imitation island greens in the past 40 years. To make the layout even more exciting during tournament play, Steve Wenzloff of PGA Tour Design Services later remodeled several holes, most significantly the 12th, which he turned into a drivable par-4, something Dye was never a fan of.,Pete Dye; Steve Wenzloff (remodel),1980,PGA Tour commissioner Deane Beman's stadium concept.

Phil Mickelson and Jimmy Walker won PGAs on it. But the Lower's most historic event was the ace by architect Robert Trent Jones in 1954 on the par-3 fourth, instantly squelching complaints of critical club members who felt Trent's redesign made it too hard. Trent's younger son, Rees, an avowed A.W. Tillinghast fan, lightly retouched the Lower's design for the 2016 PGA Championship. But there has been another changing of the guard at Baltusrol, as architect Gil Hanse and his team took over as the club's new consulting architects, and re-opened the restored Lower course—after carefully examining Tilly's old plans and reclaiming green sizes and rebuilding bunkers—in May 2021.

46,44,,,The Golf Club,New Albany,OH,Private,18,4.5,true,false,true,The Golf Club, built in 1966, may be the most authentic of Pete Dye's transition period of design, when he first chose to buck convention and start building lay-of-the-land layouts like those he'd seen during a 1963 tour of Scotland. In doing so, Dye reintroduced deception, misdirection and railroad ties into American golf architecture. Its construction attracted the attention of local boy Jack Nicklaus, who visited several times and made some astute suggestions. That led to a five-year Dye-Nicklaus design partnership. The Golf Club remained untouched for nearly 45 years, until Pete Dye returned in 2014 to rebuild holes, modestly adjusting some of his original green contours to better match present-day green speeds. He also relocated the fifth green, adding a contorted putting surface more reminiscent of his later designs, an inconspicuous reminder of how much his design predilections evolved throughout his career.,Pete Dye; Jack Nicklaus (suggestions),1966,Dye's transition period (1966).

47,55,,,Shoreacres,Lake Bluff,IL,Private,43,4.5,true,false,true,Shoreacres possesses perhaps the most fascinating topography upon which Seth Raynor ever created a golf course, a remarkable assertion given that most of the playing surfaces are dead flat, though the in-between spaces are cut through by winding depressions and several deep ravines. Raynor infused the design with his usual collection of suspects, including No. 3 (Leven), No. 6 (Biarritz), No. 7 (Double Plateau), No. 8 (Eden), No. 10 (one of the best Road Hole interpretations in the U.S.) and No. 14 (Redan) all playing along the plateaus that edge the gulleys and ravines that feed into Lake Michigan. The stretch of 11, 12 and 13, playing across a ravine, down into it, and back out of it with a blind tee shot, are as unique a stretch of holes as can be found anywhere on a 100 Greatest course. The tight turf, rivaling the firmest conditions of any parkland course, add to the challenge, and when playing as fiery as usual, shots played into the sensuously bubbled greens often have to be landed 10 or 15 yards short to be played onto the putting surfaces.,Seth Raynor,,Fascinating topography with template holes.

48,47,,,Camargo Club,Cincinnati,OH,Private,20,5,true,false,true,One of Seth Raynor's last designs, Camargo Club wasn't completed until nearly a year after his 1926 death. William Jackson, who later became the club's pro and superintendent, handled the construction and was faithful to Raynor's diagrams with two exceptions: He turned the 16th into a par 4 and the 17th into a par 5. Robert von Hagge added flashy but incongruous bunkering in the early 1960s. They lasted over 20 years, until Tom Doak undertook a restoration in the Raynor style of geometric-shaped bunkers and greens. Curiously, the Biarritz green at the par-3 eighth has never been mowed, as the 60-yard-long putting surface found on other Biarritz holes built by Raynor or his mentor C.B. Macdonald. Club officials insisted early aerial photos confirm the front half of the green was always mown at fairway height, so they continue that tradition today. Don Placek of Renaissance Golf has recently completed further renovation enhancements, including adding six acres of restored fairway to better help define the scale of the property and extending the back left section of the Road green at 17 (as well as reintroducing a second Road bunker beyond the first) to reclaim its original prodigious 15,000 square feet.,Seth Raynor; William Jackson; Robert von Hagge; Tom Doak (restoration); Don Placek (renovation),1926,Raynor died before completion (1926).

49,48,,,Erin Hills Golf Course,Hartford,WI,Public,44,4.5,true,true,true,Despite the rumor, Erin Hills wasn't designed specifically to host a U.S. Open. Its original concept was to be a simple, affordable, lay-of-the-land layout to prove Mother Nature is indeed the best golf architect. The concept changed—some greens moved, one blind par 3 eliminated—as the quest for a U.S. Open grew. That dream came true: after trial runs hosting the 2008 U.S. Women's Public Links and the 2011 U.S. Amateur, Erin Hills hosted the U.S. Open in 2017, the first time the event had ever been in Wisconsin. Brooks Koepka won with a 72-hole score of 16-under, leading some to conclude Erin Hills was too wide and defenseless. In truth, what it lacked that week was the usual gusty winds that would have effectively narrowed the slanted, canted fairways. Had the par been adjusted to 70 instead of 72 as is usual for most Opens, the score would likely have been closer to 8-under.,Michael Hurdzan; Dana Fry; Ron Whitten,,Original concept: affordable lay-of-the-land.

50,46,,,Castle Pines Golf Club,Castle Rock,CO,Private,18,4.5,true,false,true,When Golf Digest began its annual Best New Course awards in 1983, the review panel selected Castle Pines as the Private Course winner. But Bill Davis, co-founder of Golf Digest and founding father of all its course rankings, didn't care for the course and vetoed its inclusion. So, no private course was honored that year. Davis soon recognized his error, and in 1987—its first year of eligibility—Castle Pines joined America's 100 Greatest and has remained there ever since. Club founder Jack Vickers, a Midwest oilman, had urged architect Jack Nicklaus to produce a mountain-venue design worthy of a major championship. Jack did, but when a championship never resulted, Vickers established his own, The International, which for many years was the only PGA Tour event played under a unique Stableford format. The tour returned to Castle Pines in 2024 for the FedEx Cup's BMW Championship. Like Muirfield Village, the only other solo Nicklaus design in the top 50, Castle Pines has undergone a steady procession of hole alterations to keep pace with changing technology and changing tastes. It's been lengthened to over 8,000 yards, but in Castle Rock's thin air, that still only equates to about 7,300 yards.,Jack Nicklaus,1987,Vetoed for Best New Course 1983, joined top 100 in 1987.

But developer Michael Pascucci's joint venture by Jack Nicklaus with Tom Doak at Sebonack was complicated by the fact that golfer Nicklaus was also an esteemed course architect in his own right, and the project sat right beside two American icons, Shinnecock Hills and National Golf Links. Some pundits have reduced Sebonack to Tom's bunkers, Jack's greens, but in truth it's just the opposite. Doak convinced Nicklaus to go with small greens of sweeping contours and little imperfections the likes of which Jack would never have considered on his own. Meanwhile, Jack insisted that Tom tone down his usual ragged, jagged bunker faces to make them palatable to high-handicap club members. The course is fundamentally representative of neither designer's tenets, yet is a remarkable piece of architecture for the way it blends sometimes conflicting artistic outlooks into an ambitious whole on a genuinely inspiring piece of land.,Jack Nicklaus; Tom Doak,,Nicklaus-Doak collaboration.

Macdonald, partnered with Gil Hanse and partner Jim Wagner to remodel Sleepy Hollow Country Club, which consisted of 11 Macdonald-designed holes and seven added in 1927 by A.W. Tillinghast. The pair persuaded the club to allow them to rebuild the entire 18 in Macdonald's style, reasoning that Tillinghast was well represented elsewhere in Westchester County (Winged Foot, Quaker Ridge and others), but Macdonald was not. The construction was done in stages, completed well after Bahto's death in 2014. Thanks to Hanse, Sleepy Hollow now features some of Macdonald's ideal holes, like the Eden, Knoll, Leven and Road holes that weren't even part of his original design.

If so, that's because the 17th has one of the tightest greensites in America, the putting surface sitting just in front of a major street intersection, with roads right and left less than 12 paces off each collar. As befitting a seaside course, Coore and Crenshaw cleared out brush and restored many sand dune areas and removed turf in some of the roughs to expose the sand beneath, while shaper Jeff Bradley returned the jagged, windswept edges to the bunkers.

Although the Open hasn't been back in over 110 years, Myopia has always retained a reputation of being a tough little rascal with tiny greens, treacherous hazards and several cross-bunkers.

55,62,monterey-peninsula-cc,Monterey Peninsula Country Club,Monterey Peninsula Country Club: Shore,Pebble Beach,CA,Private,22,4.5,true,false,true,Mike Strantz was battling cancer while transforming the bland, low-budget Shore Course into a scenic and strategic marvel that rivals next-door neighbor Cypress Point. Strantz reversed the direction of the fifth through 15th holes to provide a Pacific Ocean backdrop to most of them. He weaved fairways among trees so players could dance among the cypress, and added native grasses for a coastal prairie look. The stunning landscape would be Strantz's last work of art. He died six months after completing the redesign. Former PGA Tour player Forrest Fezler, who was Strantz's associate on the project, later served as a consulting architect to retain the Strantz vision, until he passed away, also from cancer, in 2018.

Tillinghast design, one of the few that has remained virtually unchanged since it opened in 1918. So, it may be the most authentic Tillinghast course on the 100 Greatest. It's a charming, laid-back design that works through seemingly undisturbed rolling terrain, past rock outcroppings and around small-but-distinctive water hazards. Tilly designed this with a spoonful of whimsy, with dolomite mounds edging one green and startling knobs within another putting surface. Like Baltusrol Upper, Somerset Hills has a Tillinghast version of a Redan par 3, the second hole, which Golf Digest panelists ranked higher than any of the many splendid versions created by C.B. Macdonald or Seth Raynor, the pioneers of the template in the United States.,A.W. Tillinghast,1918,Virtually unchanged since 1918. Most authentic Tillinghast on top 100.

57,71,,,California Golf Club,South San Francisco,CA,Private,18,4.5,true,false,true,For a course that featured Alister MacKenzie bunkers (added just two years after it first opened), Cal Club was never considered the equal of its near neighbors, No. 35 Olympic Club (Lake) or No. 33 San Francisco Golf Club. That's partly because it was so claustrophobic, not just from dense trees, but from its truncated front nine reworked in the 60s by Robert Trent Jones after road expansion took two holes. Architect Kyle Phillips resolved the problem in 2007 by clearing trees and creating five new holes, including a new par-4 second in the old practice range and a new dogleg-right par-4 seventh atop a previously unused mesa in the middle of the course. Best of all, he reintroduced MacKenzie's glamorous bunkers. Cal Club is now much closer to its top-ranked neighbors and continues its meteoric rise up the charts, jumping to its highest position to date.,Alister MacKenzie; Robert Trent Jones; Kyle Phillips (2007 renovation),,MacKenzie bunkers added 2 years after opening.

Forty years later and just 22 miles away, architect David McLay Kidd also built a course on volcanic rock for very wealthy owners (Charles Schwab and George Roberts), but rather than transform the lava topography, he routed his holes among the black outcroppings and through the site's meadows of native grasses.

He just followed the corridors (the perfect width for fairways) that existed between mining spoil mounds (long since overgrown with trees) and some 40 acres of fingery lagoons that had formed as steam shovels carving out coal deposits hit the water table. Chosen as Best New Private Course of 1999, Victoria National stunned most panelists. One gushed it was, the most unusual, unpolished and unpretentious Fazio design ever. Another called it, probably the hardest Fazio course I've played. More penal than Pine Valley. Fazio concurred with that assessment. It's U.S. Open-quality now, he said soon after it opened.

The course starts in serious sand dunes, then turns inward toward meadows and dense Oregon rainforest, climbing toward an upper section at holes nine through 13. Fourteen is a love-it-or-hate-it par 4 to a thumb of a green personally fashioned by Crenshaw that can be driven with an unerring tee shot off a high bluff, dropping the holes back to the meadows and ultimately to the dunes at 17 and 18. Bump-and-run is the name of the game, but the structure of each hole requires thoughtful bumps and targeted runs. Bandon Trails is the favorite course of many Bandon Dunes frequenters, and for the first time in our rankings, it sits ahead of Old Macdonald, passing its neighbor to sit in its highest spot on our list in its history.,Bill Coore; Ben Crenshaw,,Only Bandon course not on Pacific coastline.

Some Ross fans were outraged when the course was radically altered by George and Tom Fazio in preparation for the 1979 U.S. Open. The uncle-nephew duo eliminated four holes (including the famous dogleg par-4 seventh), combined two holes to make the par-5 eighth and created three modern holes on newly acquired land. In 2018, golf architect Andrew Green replaced the Fazio holes with new ones more in the Ross style, relocated greens on two other holes and added new back tees everywhere.,Donald Ross; George Fazio; Tom Fazio; Andrew Green (2018 restoration),,Ross remodeling job.

63,68,,,Cherry Hills Country Club,Englewood,CO,Private,23,4.5,true,false,true,When Cherry Hills opened in the early 1920s, it was a ground-breaking design, with the nation's first par-5 island green and closing back-to-back par 5s, although in championships, the 18th is played as a par 4. In the 1960 U.S. Open, winner Arnold Palmer popularized the idea of a drivable par-4 by going for the first green in every round. Curiously, when Palmer and partner Ed Seay remodeled Cherry Hills in 1976, they lengthened the first hole so no player could duplicate Arnie's feat. Almost 50 years later, modern equipment has once again made the first hole reachable from the tee. A decade's worth of renovation and individual feature restoration by Tom Doak and Eric Iverson of Renaissance Golf have primed Cherry Hills for the next phase of its illustrious tournament history, which began with the 2023 U.S. Amateur.,William Flynn; Arnold Palmer; Ed Seay; Tom Doak; Eric Iverson (renovation),1920s,First par-5 island green.

64,84,,,Interlachen Country Club,Edina,MN,Private,33,5,true,false,true,When Bobby Jones won the 1930 U.S. Open at Interlachen (completing the second leg of what would become the game's first Grand Slam), fellow competitor Gene Sarazen insisted the course was tougher than everything but Oakmont. In the decades that followed a series of architects including Robert Trent Jones, Geoffrey Cornish and Brian Silva worked to keep Interlachen's edge, but nothing could staunch the march of time that made the course one-dimensional through the shrinkage of greens and the maturation of the hundreds of trees that had been planted, shading fairways and masking the property's natural land movements. Enter Andrew Green in 2023, who was given the resources to strip back the layers and rebuild the course based on the blueprints Donald Ross developed in 1922 when he remodeled the course. Interlachen's edginess is back, with ominous, strategically arranged bunkers guarding greens and fairway lines, and the expanded putting surfaces presenting a range of come-and-get-me hole locations that haven't been seen in ages. The restored bunkering shines a spotlight on Interlachen's wondrous undulation, punctuating focal points like the shared promontory of the second and seventh greens and the majestic rise toward the fortress putting surface of the par-5 12th.,Donald Ross (1922 remodel); Robert Trent Jones; Geoffrey Cornish; Brian Silva; Andrew Green (2023 restoration),1922,Bobby Jones 1930 U.S. Open (Grand Slam leg).

67,73,congressional-cc,Congressional Country Club,Congressional Country Club: Blue,Bethesda,MD,Private,30,4.5,true,false,true,Congressional's Blue Course has been an icon of traditional American parkland golf since the 1964 U.S. Open. Prior to that event, Robert Trent Jones combined nine remodeled Devereux Emmet holes with nine new ones of his own to create the modern Blue, and those holes were remodeled and reshaped several times by his son Rees for the 1997 and 2011 Opens. All the while, the trees around them matured, creating dense, shadowy corridors of wood. Drainage issues and declining course conditions motivated the membership to consider a major overhaul in 2020, and that's what they received when architect Andrew Green reimagined the course as something that Emmet might have originally designed. This denudes the property of its forests and creates broad, rollicking fairways that tumble through meadows of long fescue punctuated by fearsome bunkers and bold, segmented greens. Parkland Golf Congressional is no more, and the remodel, which included a new, drop-shot par-3 10th hole, earned the course our Best Transformation award for 2021 and a jump of 18 spots in that year's ranking of America's 100 Greatest Courses.

Chensoff decided to gamble, instructing Hurdzan-Fry to design the most unique course in South Florida despite a dead flat site. They responded by piling up fill from ponds to form ridgelines up to 58 feet, then planted them with mature oaks, pines and sabal palms. Calusa Pines sports perhaps the firmest, fastest Bermuda fairways and greens in Florida, currently rivaled only by the turf at Streamsong. Recent removal of overgrown vegetation between holes has returned beautiful long-range views to the course and made it more playable.

69,NEW,sand-valley,Sand Valley,Sand Valley: The Lido,Nekoosa,WI,Public,48,4.5,true,true,true,The Lido at Sand Valley in central Wisconsin opened in May 2023 and is a down-to-the-inch recreation of The Lido that C.B. Macdonald built on Long Island from 1914 to 1917. Heralded as one of the country's greatest courses, it went extinct in the 1940s when the U.S. government converted the land to a naval base. The Lido is alive again as a private club associated with Sand Valley Resort. The club operates in the same vein as the clubs of the British Isles, allowing select play from resort guests on Mondays through Thursdays.Rebuilding The Lido has been the fantasy of many historians, but doing so accurately became possible when Peter Flory, a financial consultant and architecture enthusiast, developed a detailed computer simulation of the course based on scrupulous study of old photographs and other material. Sand Valley proprietors Michael and Chris Keiser discovered Flory's computer model, then asked architect Tom Doak if he could use it to rebuild the course.First, the animated contours had to be translated into a physical GPS topographical blueprint, a technological hack accomplished by digital mapping specialist Brian Zager. The GPS map enabled Doak and his associates to reconstruct Lido holes like Plateau, Alps, Cape and Long in exquisite detail, along with originals like the Dog's Leg sixth and the Home 18th, making only minor adjustments for drainage and adding longer tees for modern play. Though there's no Atlantic Ocean crashing near the Biarritz eighth green or stiff coastal winds swatting around balls, the new Lido is a stunning representation of Macdonald's groundbreaking accomplishment and a vivid throwback to a more daring era of architecture. Using the spacious hole corridors to explore different routes into the giant greens is half the fun. Contemplating players navigating holes like the Channel fourth, with an alternative island fairway for daring hitters and a green perched behind a high rampart bunker, using hickory shafts and Haskell balls, is the other half.,C.B.

73,93,medinah-cc,Medinah Country Club,Medinah Country Club: No. 3,Medinah,IL,Private,27,4.5,true,false,true,The evolution of golf course architecture—and how courses change to suit the demands of the times—can be mapped directly on top of Medinah's No. 3 course. It was built in the 1920s within the fields west of Chicago on land that was part farmland and partly wooded. It became a major championship site when it hosted the 1949 U.S. Open, putting it on a track of perpetual improvements to toughen it up to keep pace with tournament demands. To whit, the old 17th hole, a par-3 over water, shifted and morphed several times between 1986 and 2005, and the greens and bunkers have undergone remodels ahead of each event, from Opens, to PGA Championships to Ryder Cups. But when No. 3 was blistered to the tune of 25-under during the 2019 BMW Championship, which coincided with a plunge in our rankings from 53rd to 93rd, the club knew it was time to adapt again. They took a swing and hired the Australian firm of Ogilvy, Cocking and Mead to overhaul the design with the notion of making the course look and play like it might have in the 1920s. That meant removing much of the dense forest surrounding the holes, revamping the bunkers in more naturalistic forms, enlarging the greens and adding internal contour, eliminating two of the three redundant par 3s that played over Lake Kadijah and building several new holes, including the drivable 16th over the lake. The radical shift has put the fun, firmness and variety back into a design that had become one-dimensional, predictable and soft, and the result is a jump of 19 spots in the ranking.,Tom Bendelow; Ogilvy, Cocking and Mead (overhaul),1920s,Built 1920s.

Tillinghast design each year. This includes reclaiming putting surfaces back to Tillinghast dimensions, except on the sporty par-4 17th green, where a left-hand lobe that had been added by Frank Duane in 1964 was chopped off. Quaker's strong suit has long been its powerful par-4s, such as the fourth hole with a collection of hazards needing to be navigated off the tee, the sixth, where tee shots must be squeezed between a creek and hillside and the drive-and-pitch 11th, where the green is girdled by a stream.

75,67,,,Spyglass Hill Golf Course,Pebble Beach,CA,Public,40,4.5,true,true,true,Given the task of designing a course just up the 17 Mile Drive from Pebble Beach and Cypress Point, Robert Trent Jones responded with a combination of Pine Valley and Augusta National. The five opening holes, in Pine Valley-like sand dunes, are an all-too-brief encounter with the Pacific seacoast. The remaining holes are a stern hike through hills covered with majestic Monterey pines (which, sad to say, may someday disappear to pitch canker, but are being replaced in some areas with cypress trees). Add several water hazards that hearken back to the 16th at Augusta (a hole which Trent Jones designed, by the way), and you have what some panelists consider to be Trent's finest work. Others say it's the best course never to have hosted a major event (though it was conceived to do so).

It was completed by Robert Hunter, a partner to Alister MacKenzie (who did not participate in the work), and Raynor's ideas for the greens were altered before they were even built. In the 1990s, Rees Jones remodeled the course and reshaped holes to mimic the Raynor look, to mixed reviews. In 2016, Tom Fazio was brought in to make the Dunes as appealing to members as the gorgeous Shore Course, though it was former associates Tim Jackson and David Kahn who conceived of and carried out the details of the plan to give the Dunes a MacKenzie look. Sandscapes now frame most holes, fairways now zigzag around jagged bunkers and nearly all the greens are oriented diagonally to lines of play.

77,78,,,Essex County Club,Manchester,MA,Private,33,5,true,false,true,Essex County Club is considered the first great Donald Ross design and perhaps his most intriguing. He wasn't the original architect, but he served as its professional from 1909 to 1913 (until his design business became so lucrative he no longer needed the pro job) and lived on site, so he was able to tweak many holes. Ultimately, he returned to do a substantial remodeling in 1917. Unusual holes are the order of the day, from the flat opening six holes with fuzzy chocolate drops covered in tall fescue grasses to the blind shots, both uphill and downhill, on the back nine. The par-3 11th, with its green resembling the deck of a sinking ship, and the downhill par-4 18th, shaped like an S around small hills, are special. The club insists its third green, created in 1893 and preserved by Ross in his remodel, is the oldest green in continuous existence in America.,Donald Ross,1917,Ross served as pro 1909-1913, lived on-site, tweaked holes. 1917 substantial remodeling.

82,60,,,Scioto Country Club,Columbus,OH,Private,30,4.5,true,false,true,The Donald Ross design at Scioto was the site of three prominent tournaments—the 1926 U.S. Open, won by Bobby Jones, the 1931 Ryder Cup and the 1950 PGA Championship. That course was gone by the time the '68 U.S. Amateur came to Scioto, replaced in 1963 by a modern design from Dick Wilson, who delegated one nine to associate Joe Lee and the other to associate Robert von Hagge. Several other renovations by Michael Hurdzan and Jack Nicklaus, who grew up playing the course, followed in the 2000s, creating yet a third iteration of the course. Enough, the club said. They hired Andrew Green in 2021 to restore the course to the full Donald Ross version based on drawings, photos and an old aerial illustration from the '26 Open. Green lowered green complexes, emboldened contours, recreated Ross' sharp-faced bunkering and returned the small green at the par-3 17th to the near side of a creek where it originally was.,Donald Ross; Dick Wilson; Joe Lee; Robert von Hagge; Michael Hurdzan; Jack Nicklaus; Andrew Green (2021 restoration),,Ross hosted 1926 U.S. Open (Bobby Jones), 1931 Ryder Cup, 1950 PGA.

83,NEW,,,Ladera Golf Club,Thermal,CA,Private,20,5,true,false,true,Ladera breaks every rule of desert golf in Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley. The design does not incorporate unnatural water features, it's not lined by palm trees, it's not criss-crossed by cart paths and it's not hemmed in by housing, no matter how expensive. Instead, it is a beautiful and varied expression of what desert golf can be in its most natural form, though nothing about it is natural. The 300-acre site slopes 140 feet from the high point near the Santa Rosa Mountains across once-level land that was formerly lemon groves and mango farms. Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner propped up the low side of the property to reorient sightlines over the valley floor toward the eastern Mecca Hills and moved millions of cubic yards of earth to create each particle of golf. Ladera's fairways are generous, 60 to 100 yards wide with no formal rough, but strategy abounds with options to play to wide parts of the fairway—though the best approach angles and lines of sight are reserved for those who skirt the boundaries of the hazards. Even completely straight holes, such as the par-5 seventh, are full of options with staggered bunkers and a treacherous side slope short of the green. The greens reveal a tremendous variety of sizes and forms, some modestly contoured like the enormous saucer third and others a pattern of ridges and falling tiers (the 14th). But the most distinctive features at Ladera are the attractive dry gullies and arroyos that Hanse, Wagner and their team cut through the site emulating sandy, eroded vegetative lows that water would rush through during rare periods of heavy rain. The excavated sand was used to create sweeping elevation changes and to prop up greens like the par-3 fourth, the altar-like 15th, the par-3 16th and the par-5 17th that hangs over the edge of a deep barranca.,Gil Hanse; Jim Wagner,,NEW to rankings.

84,80,baltusrol-gc,Baltusrol Golf Club,Baltusrol Golf Club: Upper,Springfield,NJ,Private,27,4.5,true,false,true,It's believed that when A.W. Tillinghast began constructing the Upper and Lower Courses at Baltusrol in 1919 (replacing Baltusrol's existing 18 holes), it was the first contiguous 36 holes built at the same time in America. Because of the Lower's tremendous major championship record, most consider the slightly shorter Upper to be a secondary course at the club. But between the two, it was the Upper, not the Lower, that hosted the first U.S. Open (and third in the club's history) in 1936, won by Tony Manero. The Lower didn't get its first Open until 1954, won by Ed Furgol. Baltusrol Mountain, just 200 feet high, looms above the right flank of the Upper, complicating drives and putts with a landscape that tilts more than appears to the eye. Just like he did at the Lower, Gil Hanse and his team finished a complete restoration of the Upper in 2024, the fruits of which won't appear in this ranking until 2027.,A.W.

85,91,,,The Quarry at La Quinta,La Quinta,CA,Private,23,5,true,false,true,The developers of The Quarry hired Tom Fazio in the early 1990s with instructions that he top his design of Shadow Creek (ranked No. 24 on this year's list). Fazio was savvy enough to ignore those instructions because he recognized The Quarry's site was a much better piece of topography than what he'd been provided in Las Vegas. Thus, The Quarry has more variety, starting and ending in a gravel quarry now lavishly landscaped. In between, holes play on high desert overlooking the Palm Springs Valley and in a valley, with four holes tucked in an isolated notch of the Santa Rosa Mountains. The course regularly receives some of the highest Conditioning scores in the country.,Tom Fazio,1990s,Fazio ignored instructions to top Shadow Creek. Better topography.

86,85,,,Canyata Golf Club,Marshall,IL,Private,14,4,true,false,true,Energy-industry CEO Jerry Forsythe grew up in east central Illinois and wanted to convert 300 acres of his childhood memories into a family retreat. After golf architect Bob Lohmann built him an elaborate three-hole golf course on the property, Lohmann's then-associate Mike Benkusky convinced Forsythe to stretch it to nine holes and later into a full 18. Ultimately, two million cubic yards of cornfield were moved to form Canyata's massive fairways and greens, which are edged by waterscaped ponds, artificial creeks and a dazzling array of bunkers. With only a handful of rounds played each year by invited guests, Canyata's manicuring is always nearly flawless. That changed in 2025 after the course's acquisition by Texas-based Escalante Golf, which opened the club to a small national membership.,Bob Lohmann; Mike Benkusky,,CEO's childhood memories converted to family retreat. 2 million cubic yards of cornfield moved.

87,75,,,Butler National Golf Club,Oak Brook,IL,Private,33,4.5,true,false,true,Butler National was former tour player George Fazio's ideal of a championship course, with 10 forced carries over water in 18 holes. Even before it opened, it was signed to eventually serve as a permanent site of the Western Open. The problem was, when it opened, it was the last cool-weather venue on the PGA Tour to utilize bluegrass rather than bentgrass for its fairways, and several prominent golfers declined to play Butler National because of potential flyer-lies from those fairways. Eventually, the turf was converted, but then the Shoal Creek scandal occurred. Rather than change its restricted men-only policy, the club relinquished its role of Western Open host after the 1990 event. So why include a club on America's 100 Greatest that won't allow female panelists a chance to evaluate it? Because we rank golf courses, not club policies.,George Fazio,,Fazio's championship ideal. 10 forced water carries.

88,88,,,Hudson National Golf Club,Croton On Hudson,NY,Private,40,4,true,false,true,Hudson National rests on dramatic bluffs high over the Hudson River valley, a breathtaking location that, back in the 1920s, had been the site of the ill-fated Hessian Hills Country Club. (The fireplace and part of the foundation of its clubhouse still exists near the fourth green.) Fazio paid little attention to the old routing, however, dynamiting more than 130,000 cubic feet of granite to fit his design into the rocky terrain. Greens are blazing fast, the primary rough is wispy fescue and bunkers are deep and numerous. Hudson National closed in 2023 as the Fazio team returned for a complete remodeling, finishing plans they couldn't execute the first time around. The entire course was re-grassed with modern bents, bunkers were shifted and reshaped and greens were enlarged with several reoriented with new low-mow chipping areas as surrounds. The most notable improvements are the new, larger and three-dimensionally sculpted fifth green replacing one of the most placid on the course and the new green at the par-5 14th set tight against a lake that's been elongated and extended 25 yards to create more tantalizing back hole locations.,Tom Fazio,1920s,Dramatic bluffs over Hudson River.

89,89,,,The Kittansett Club,Marion,MA,Private,27,4.5,true,false,true,Only recently, with the discovery of some original blueprints, has it been conclusively established that the ocean-side, links-like Kittansett, long thought to be the product of an amateur architect, Frederic C. Hood, was actually the work of well-known course architect William Flynn, who also designed Shinnecock Hills and Cherry Hills. Credit that revelation to authors Wayne S. Morrison and Thomas E. Paul, who reveal that and much more in their massive 2,260-page biography of Flynn entitled The Nature Faker: William S. Flynn, Golf Architect. Credit Gil Hanse with restoring the bunkers without the aid of those Flynn plans. Instead, he used old aerial photographs.

90,82,,,Plainfield Country Club,Edison,NJ,Private,26,4.5,true,false,true,In the late 1990s, Gil Hanse and his team gradually began restoring all of Plainfield's Donald Ross features, including many that had become covered by trees or lost over the years. During the early 2000s, every green, fairway, teeing ground, chipping area and bunker was restored. Meanwhile, excessive trees were removed. The result is an exceptional restoration/renovation of one of Donald Ross' very best designs, and it could not be more fun to play every day. The tree removal also opened up strategic playing angles, optionality and stunning views across the property. The course remains a great venue for competitions as well, with USGA and PGA Tour events producing an impressive list of champions, including John Cook, Laura Davies, Dustin Johnson and Jason Day. Plainfield has committed to three future USGA Championships, including the 2025 U.S. Amateur Four-Ball, 2031 U.S. Senior Women's Open and the 2037 U.S. Senior Open.,Donald Ross; Gil Hanse (restoration),,Hanse gradual restoration late 1990s-early 2000s.

91,90,,,Boston Golf Club,Hingham,MA,Private,15,4.5,true,false,true,Boston Golf Club, in the southern suburb of Hingham, is a modern-day Pine Valley, massaged by architect Gil Hanse and his team from dramatic coastal topography with gashes of unsullied sand. Fairways tumble across the landscape, posing some blind shots that are embraced, not criticized. One stretch surrounds an old strip mine, with mining spoils incorporated as chocolate-drop mounds. One vein of sand serves as a Hell's One-Third Acre hazard. Like Garden City Golf Club, Boston finishes with a terrific par-3.,Gil Hanse,,Modern-day Pine Valley.

92,94,,,Pete Dye Golf Club,Bridgeport,WV,Private,18,5,true,false,true,Like No. 31 Pikewood National, Pete Dye Golf Club is a 100 Greatest course built atop a West Virginia mining deposit, but in this case, it's an active coal mine. (The club's original name was Coal Ridge.) Evidence of that fact is everywhere, from the strip-mine wall along the par-5 eighth and the black cinder bunkers on the par-4 sixth to the abandoned coal train that curls around the outside of the dogleg on the 10th. There's even a coal mine shaft that leads to the seventh tee. Construction took so long that Dye's style had evolved by the time the full 18 was finally seeded. Early holes sport the railroad-tie motif of Oak Tree National, while later holes feature the echo-chamber bunkering of Whistling Straits.,Pete Dye,,Built atop active coal mine (originally Coal Ridge).

93,96,,,Pasatiempo Golf Club,Santa Cruz,CA,Public,32,4.5,true,true,true,Pasatiempo is arguably Alister MacKenzie's favorite design. He lived along its sixth fairway during his last years. With its elaborate greens and spectacular bunkering fully restored by Jim Urbina, it's a prime example of MacKenzie's art. The five par 3s are daunting yet delightful, culminating with the 181-yard over-a-canyon 18th. The back nine is chock full of other great holes: 10, 11, 12 and 16 all play over barrancas. The storied course has hosted two USGA championships: the 1986 U.S. Women's Amateur and the 2004 U.S. Senior Women's Amateur. In 2014, Pasatiempo received a Golf Digest Green Star environmental award for its measures in dealing with drought. Today, water worries are in the past, in part because of a new storage tank that allows the club to capture and store recycled water. Urbina's last greens restoration, completed in late 2024, has resurrected lost hole locations throughout the course, and the club will maintain them at slightly slower speeds to embrace the brilliant contours MacKenzie designed.,Alister MacKenzie; Jim Urbina (restoration),,MacKenzie's favorite design.

94,87,,,Valhalla Golf Club,Louisville,KY,Private,32,4.5,true,false,true,Given a difficult piece of land on which to create Valhalla (half the site was floodplain, with high-tension power poles), Jack Nicklaus drew on his training under Pete Dye and Desmond Muirhead to produce a unique design, with an alternate-fairway par-5, a par-4 with an island green and an 18th green shaped like a horseshoe. Over the decades, Nicklaus returned periodically to update its challenges, and the club rebuilt bunkers and replaced its soft bentgrass fairways with firmer, faster zoysia in 2022. Valhalla has proven to be a great championship site where play almost always comes down to the final hole. This has been true at each of the four thrilling PGA Championships, including narrow wins by Rory McIlroy in 2014 and Xander Schauffele in 2024.,Jack Nicklaus,,Nicklaus drew on Dye and Muirhead training.

95,77,,,Diamond Creek,Banner Elk,NC,Private,21,5,true,false,true,While architecture purists scoff at the notion of waterfalls on golf courses, there is something magnificent about a cascading water feature done right. Few are as effective as the one behind the par-3 17th green at Diamond Creek. Tom Fazio positioned the green nearly at the base of a sheer granite quarry wall, down which a slender stream of water drops more than 100 feet. Amazingly, the club entrance's drive is also at the base of the quarry wall, hidden from view on the 17th as effectively as Fazio hides his cart paths.,Tom Fazio,,Par-3 17th with waterfall dropping 100 feet from sheer granite quarry wall.

96,83,,,Dallas National Golf Club,Dallas,TX,Private,16,4,true,false,true,It occupies some of the best golfing terrain in the Dallas Metroplex—rugged hills dotted with cedars—yet Tom Fazio still indulged in considerable shifting of earth when creating Dallas National. The par-3 17th, for instance, is countersunk into an excavated box canyon of rock, while a deep ravine in front of the 18th green was filled in to lessen the difficulty of the approach for average players. Major championship golf will return to the Dallas area in 2027 when the PGA Championship will be held on the recently opened East Course at PGA Frisco, built by Gil Hanse & Jim Wagner, but Dallas National members feel they already have a course worthy of the task. The course is poised to be even more polished when it reopens in 2025 following a major touch-up by Team Fazio.,Tom Fazio,,Best terrain in Dallas. Par-3 17th countersunk into box canyon.

97,86,,,Milwaukee Country Club,River Hills,WI,Private,18,4.5,true,false,true,With much of the course hard against the Milwaukee River and several holes subject to flooding (the green of the 12th and the entire 13th are located across the river), one might think Milwaukee Country Club is a flat layout. But many of its holes are surprisingly hilly. Its classic design is still tree-lined, but one of the crucial improvements recently made by consulting architect Tom Doak and his associate Don Placek was to remove many trees to open up views of the river on the upland holes.,Tom Doak; Don Placek,,Hard against Milwaukee River. 12th green and entire 13th across river.

98,97,,,Piping Rock Club,Locust Valley,NY,Private,25,4.5,true,false,true,C.B. Macdonald designed Piping Rock right after he completed National Golf Links, and just as he did there, Macdonald peppered Piping Rock with versions of his favorite design concepts, including a canted Redan green and a Road Hole based on the 17th at St. Andrews. But it was at Piping Rock, not National, where Macdonald first introduced what has become his most imitated hole, the Biarritz. It's the ninth hole at Piping Rock, with a green 60 yards deep, bisected two-thirds of the way back by a six-foot-deep trench. Designer Bruce Hepner recently enhanced the course by removing trees, reinstating old cross bunkers, recapturing green sizes and adding tightly mown green surrounds to some holes. But he didn't change the design. Piping Rock had great bones to begin with.,C.B. Macdonald; Bruce Hepner (enhancements),,Right after National Golf Links.

99,101,,,Crooked Stick Golf Club,Carmel,IN,Private,20,4.5,true,false,true,Crooked Stick is the course where Pete Dye became Pete Dye. Conceived following an extended tour of British courses, Pete founded Crooked Stick, located the land, raised the funds and designed the course, rejecting conventional golf holes in favor of radical ones, using bulkheads of vertical telephone poles to create abrupt change and long expanses of sand to emulate dunes. What's more, he built it himself, pressing even his wife, Alice, and young sons, Perry and P.B., into construction work. They opened the back nine first, in 1965, with MacKenzie-style boomerang greens; the front nine came two years later, with lines and angles appropriated from Donald Ross. Crooked Stick was the first Dye course to host a major championship, the 1991 PGA Championship, just a month before the Ryder Cup visited his brand-new Ocean Course at Kiawah Island. Tom Doak finished renovation work in late 2024, but the goal was to enhance and sharpen the Dye features rather than change them, so the changes may not be noticeable.,Pete Dye; Tom Doak (2024 renovation),1965,Where Pete Dye became Pete Dye.

100,95,,,Aronimink Golf Club,Newtown Square,PA,Private,35,4.5,true,false,true,Aronimink is an object lesson in architectural evolution. After Donald Ross completed his design in 1928, he proclaimed, I intended to make this my masterpiece. That didn't keep club members from bringing in William Gordon in the 1950s to eliminate out-of-play fairway bunkers and move other bunkers closer to greens. The course was later revamped by Dick Wilson, George Fazio and Robert Trent Jones. In the 1990s and into the 2000s, Ron Prichard, one of the profession's original restoration specialists, began returning Aronimink back to Ross' conception based on the architect's drawings and field diagrams. But there was always a discrepancy between what Ross drew in plans and what was actually built in 1928. A more recent renovation by Gil Hanse and Jim Wagner, who live nearby, has put the course's architecture more in line with what aerial photographs depict of the early design, particularly the bunkering that might have been imagined as larger in scale but built in smaller, more scatter-shot formations.,Donald Ross; William Gordon; Dick Wilson; George Fazio; Robert Trent Jones; Ron Prichard (restoration); Gil Hanse; Jim Wagner (renovation),1928,Ross intended as masterpiece.
