# The JDGA Official App - Original Vision

This document contains the complete, unmodified original vision for the app as provided by the creator.

---

i'd like to build a new app for golf enthusiasts in the United States. Players of golf, not just fans. Players that have played thousands of rounds, on many of the top public and private courses in the US, as well as a handful internationally. Players who could name the top 25 rated courses in America right off the top of their head, but may play at other top 250 rated courses over the span of one or multiple years. Players that log in roughly 100-200 rounds a year. Players that have a collage of the scoring pencil they've used at any of the top 50 courses they've played. Players that could easily recall what their top score was at almost any course they every played. My first test-user will be one specific close friend of mine. I know a little about golf, but he knows 50x what i know. I want the app to allow him to do many things: refer to the list of top courses in the US and the top courses across different continents outside of north america. The app will let him quickly check off which of those courses he's played at. It will let him record his top score and even let him optionally manually fill out an entire scorecard for one or many rounds at that course, OR use embedded camera function and OCR technology to import a scorecard. The app will let him create contact entries of anyone he remembers having played a round with at that course, whether close friend or one-time playing mate. App will let him create/mark who he knows that is a member of the club. For the course/club that he is a member at, he can record who he plays with, guests he invites to play with him, guests that he invites to use his name to be able to have permission to play without him present that day (this is a common practice in the private golf club community). He could rank his favorite holes at any course, both within the context of that course, as well as a running list of his favorite holes at ANY course. He could record his favorite drink or menu item at any clubhouse. Could mark clubs that if he plays there, what apparel/souvenir items he knows he'll want to purchase in the clubhouse, for himself or as a gift to anyone else he knows who'd like it. The app will have a historical list of all clubs that have hosted any US major tournament and what year, and any of the confirmed future major tournement host-courses. There will of course be info such as date course opened, name of the designer of the course, founders and/or current ownership company of the course. Number of courses at the club and the names of those courses. The length of the course respective to the different teeboxes. Info that i'm not an expert of such as official course "rating" "grading" things like that. It will list the top 3 or so finishers of every US Major tournement each year. It will list the closest public airport and closes private airport to each club. It will list the average flight time from his home airport to those airports. It will list ground transport distance from those airports to the course. It will list highest rated hotels that are in the vicinity of the course. It will list 5 of the highest rated restaurants in the vicinity of the course. App will allow user to identify how many times they have played a course, or estimate, as well as make note of how often they would ideally LIKE to play that course (once a year, once every X years, X times per year). The app will be named "The JDGA Official App". I am not a very experienced dev of apps but have used Claude Code to generate over 40k lines of code across several apps in the last month. I have a Max $200/month plan. Don't skimp on the effort/tokens/cost/detail of this app. I don't know a ton about stack, but I do like the results I've been getting when dev'ing Contacts-Quiz and Circles-Sandbox that you can find locally in dir swdevprojects>nikki-matt-projects. The app will run completely staticly on user's device and not capture user's data or have connectivity to other users -- YET. App shall have weather incorporated so that if user selects any month of the year, then the optimal courses to play that month will be different from the/any list that assumes ideal conditions. If user has a non-golf trip planned to any city, app shall suggest courses, depending on month and even week of the year to account for whether. Users of this app will at times happily play public golf courses but only very good ones. For now, the app need not include direct online tee-time booking options for every course, but should include an address and direct phone number. App shall allow user to record in the app a person they know who knows a member, if they themselves do not directly know a member. There will be a well-rounded Golf Buddies component of the app that performs as an address book ONLY consisting of contacts they have that they already have played golf with or know to play golf and WOULD play with them if given the chance. User shall be able to enter in Name, City, where they are a member (if known) and rate how frequently that person is known to the user to play golf and how good their are. Probably 3 tiers for each (low/mid/high frequency, low/mid/high skill). Probably good to allow user to enter in approx age of the contact. As it's own component of the app, the contacts component will allow user to seemlessly assign those contacts to clubs and make those contacts with a recorded home-city be suggested playing partners for user at any clubs/courses in or near the city of that contact (of course in addition to the club(s) that contact is a member of. Mind you that many highly skilled recreational golfers are members at clubs in cities they either live in only part of the year, or don't even live in at all but justify membership by the quality of their time spent at that club rather than the quantity. The appearance of the app should be top-notch professional b2c app quality, classic with a hint of modern. You are in planning mode. start making an absolutely fantastic plan. Deadline to complet the MVP of this app is 30 days from now. We have time. Accuracy IS Speed. But let's make it high functioning and beautiful very soon, and spend the rest of the time perfecting it.
